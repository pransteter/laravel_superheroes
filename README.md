Basic application with a simple CRUD of Heroes using Laravel Framework.

## Getting Started



### Prerequisites

You'll need to install docker, PHP and composer.
Here, as we can install using the debian bash:

Docker:
```
sudo apt-get install docker docker-compose docker.io
```

Php7.0 (necessary to use Composer)
```
sudo apt-get php7.0
```

Composer
```
sudo apt-get composer
```

### Installing

Firstly you need to create an environment to run it. So, inside laravel_superheroes folder, using the bash, hit this:

```
sudo docker-compose up
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
